the answer is \"turds\". want to know how to get this answer? here it is:  decifered -   read this backwards and you shall see the riddle will reveal itself to thee  the clue is a number the answer is not caused through inorder currently out of order the answer lies within   after this, the top paragraph is used for only one thing. the word \"backwards\"  after you decifer the riddle, you still have to do some backwards reading. \"the clue is a number\". to get this number, count the number of words in each line, for the first, its 5. count from the end of the line \"r\" and count 5 letters back. you end with \"u\". do the same for the rest, and you end with :  \"usdrt\"  the next part, is a riddle in itself. \"caused through inorder currently out of order the answer lies within\"  the \"caused through inorder\" is suggesting an anagram. the \"answer lies within\" means that the answer is the solved anagram.  if we solve the anagram, we come up with two results that make sense. \"durst\" and \"turds\" now think, a teenager made this riddle, it would seem strange having an answer like \"durst\" leaving only one possibility.  yep, you guessed it. the answer is \"turds\"

Jason McCubbins, Ray's business partner. The calendar is the clue to solving this murder. The police realized that since Mr. Whitcombe was wearing his watch on his right arm, he must be left handed. But the pen was found in his right hand. Realizing that the number on the calendar was written in a hurry and with his opposite hand, police matched the written number with the months of the year. So the B was an 8, thereby giving us 7-8-9-10-11: July, August, September, October, November. Use the first letter of each month and it spells J-A-S-O-N.
